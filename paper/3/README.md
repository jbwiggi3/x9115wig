##Artifacts:
###Motivation: 
Considering high-level features, such as the words used in a bug report, automatic triaging is susceptible to dependence on a certain language, noisy data and handling domain specific term variations. A lower-level feature, such as character level features overcome these boundaries.
###Hypotheses: 
Character n-gram-based features will out-preform high-level features based models for predicting duplicate bugs.
###Contributions: 
- This character level approach provides the following advantages over word-level representations: 1) Ability to match concepts from system messages; 2) Ability to extract super-word features; 3) Handling misspelled words; 4) Ability to match short-forms with their expanded form; 5) Ability to match term variations to a common root; 6) Ability to match hyphenated phrases

- *iv4)* There is no future work section in this paper or any allusion to it in the conclusion section. It is difficult to speculate what the next steps should be as a reader and it would be nice to see what direction this line of work could go in. As it stands, I'm not sure that this approach is really that strong and without room for improvement I wonder if this is work worth doing.
